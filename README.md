# Kinen Workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions for the Kinen methodology.

## For Users

These workflows are already set up in your Kinen Space. You don't need to do anything here.

See [kinen-club/space](https://github.com/kinen-club/space) to get started.

## What These Do

- **Onboarding** - Welcomes you when you create your space
- **Agent** - Runs AI sessions when you email your inbox

## Updating

Your space automatically uses the latest workflows. To pin to a specific version:

```yaml
uses: kinen-club/workflows/.github/workflows/agent.yml@v1
```
