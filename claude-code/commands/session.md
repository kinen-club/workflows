Use your kinen-core skill to start a new structured thinking session.

**Full methodology:** `methodology/core.md`

**Steps:**
1. Ask what we're exploring and determine session type (Architecture, Implementation, Writing, Research)
2. Create session folder: `sessions/YYYYMMDD-NN-session-name/`
3. Create `init.md` with goals, constraints, key questions
4. Create living document skeleton in `artifacts/`
5. Begin foundation round (01-foundation.md)

**Remember:** You are a thinking partner - challenge assumptions, provide alternatives.
